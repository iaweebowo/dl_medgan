# MedGANx
CS 7643 - Deep Learning Final Project

This repository is a collection of files used for our MedGANx implementation. The vast majority of the files were made to run with Google Colab, with CUDA.
- Our baseline AC-GAN implementation can be found in baseline_accgan_kp.ipynb.
- Our MedGANx implementation can be found in medganx.ipynb.
- Our FID and SSIM evaluation code can be found in medgan_evaluation_v2.ipynb.
- Code used to make the graphs in the paper are included in graphs.ipynb.
- We also include the model weights and metrics in the logs folder.
